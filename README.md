## web + mobile

## state management

## Analytics

- GA4 + firebase

## Accessibility

## Light/Dark mode aka Themes

## api state management

- Get entitlement

## Translations

## Design Service

- NEED: How does this get into the Flutter app?
- Handles cobranding white labeling and different app ecosystem styles
- Could be cool: Should this be a javascript process, api call
- WHY?
    - Information is passed through too
    - Central place to give back current styling & information
        - fonts, colors
        - menu
        - phone numbers
        - header
        - footer
        - dropdown for entitlement switching
    - Kinda like the Microsoft Office
        - A way to frame our apps in a simple and cohesive way like Microsoft Office and so we donâ€™t have unicorn apps

## Axiom

- Always get happy-path
- Do we just design and implement gaps?
